    <string name="privacy_policy_1">
        This app reads weight from a scale, using the camera,
        then writes the resulting weight into Android Health Connect.
        It only does so when the app is active.

        This app does not read any data from Health Connect.

    <string name="privacy_policy_3">
        When used with debug mode disabled, this app does not store
        any weight data (raw image or processed number) by itself. All
        of the weight data is stored, on your device, by the Health
        Connect service.

        When debug mode is enabled, and the "Save images (debug)" menu
        item is pressed, this app will save the last few captured images
        on your device (which may include the readout weight). These images
        are easily viewed in any image viewer (e.g. Google Photos), and can
        be deleted there.
